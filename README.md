# Human-gesture-detection-using-YOLOv5
Welcome to the Human Gesture Detection project repository! 
This project utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm, to detect and analyze human gestures. 
In this repository, you will find the following key folders:

  1. test_output:
  This folder contains the test results obtained after training the YOLOv5 model.
  Inside this folder, you will find another folder named weights, which houses the weights generated during the training process.
  These weights are crucial for reproducing and fine-tuning the model.
  Please refer to the documentation or the capstone report for information on how to use these weights.

  2. results:
  The results folder contains real-life results showcasing the performance of the trained YOLOv5 model in detecting human gestures.
  These results are visual representations of the model's accuracy and effectiveness in various scenarios.
  Feel free to explore these results to gain insights into the project's real-world application.

  3. capstone_report:
  The capstone_report folder includes a comprehensive report detailing the entire project.
  This report covers the problem statement, methodology, dataset used, model architecture, training process, and a thorough analysis of the obtained results.
  Reading through this report will provide you with a deep understanding of the project's objectives and outcomes.

How to Use This Repository:
  Weights and Model Deployment:
    If you intend to use the trained model weights for inference or further training, navigate to the test_output/weights folder.
    Refer to the capstone report for instructions on loading these weights into the YOLOv5 model.
